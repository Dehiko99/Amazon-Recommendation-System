# Project Description

The goal of the project is to create a powerful recommendation system that is able to predict the scores given by the users. In order to achieve that, I used the **Neural Collaborative Filtering** (which combines **user-item relationships** and learns complex relationships between them through neural networks, improving the ability to recommend items based on historical behavior). Recommendation Systems are models strongly used nowadays (for instance by Netflix, Amazon, etc) because they help users to discover new products or services by filtering vasts amount of information based on individual preferences and behaviours.

In the dataset ratings goes from 0 to 10, where 0 identifes implicit feedback. In order to predict more accurately explicit feedback, those were removed from the dataset.
